"""#########################################################################
This script:
1) merges multiple qualtrics csvs (from multiple surveys) if more than one exits
2) only keeps the relevant task sets (e.g., SSS... and SSS2v....)
3) Keeps only the most recent taskset when more than one subject completed the same taskset (e.g., if on Monday SSS0001
was completed and on Tuesday SSS0001 was completed by another participant. Only the Tuesday data will be saved.)
4) Saves the cleaned up and merged file
